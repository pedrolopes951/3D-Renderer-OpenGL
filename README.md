# 3D and 2D Renderer

This project is a versatile 3D and 2D renderer created using Visual Studio for Win32. The renderer allows you to draw and manipulate various shapes in both 2D and 3D spaces. It leverages the ImGui framework for the 2D rendering aspects, providing a user-friendly interface for scaling, translating, and rotating objects.

## Features

### 3D Renderer
- Draw 3D shapes: pyramid, cube, and sphere.
- Camera control: Move around using WASD keys.
- Zoom: Utilize the scroll wheel for zooming.

### 2D Renderer
- Draw 2D shapes: triangles, squares, and circles.
- ImGui Integration: Easily scale, translate, and rotate objects using the ImGui framework.
